# tempered_diffusion
This code was created with MATLAB_R2017A to solve tempered fractional diffusion problems in 1D with reflecting boundary conditions.
Both explicit and implicit Euler methods are implemented for both normalized and centered normalized tempered fractional diffusion equations.
The implementation includes functionality for left- and right-sided Riemann-Liouville derivatives and a convex combination of the two.
To run the code, set desired parameter values in simulate_tempered.m and run.
